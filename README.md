# Java Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn Java through W3Schools and brush up on existing knowledge.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:

* Track my learning progress in Java.
* Serve as a personal reference for concepts and code examples.
* Reinforce my understanding of Java fundamentals and advanced topics.
* Provide a space for experimentation and practice.

## Resources

* **W3Schools Java Tutorial:** [https://www.w3schools.com/java/](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)

## Contents

This repository may contain:

* Java code examples and exercises.
* Notes and summaries of key concepts.
* Small projects and experiments.
* Any relevant documentation.

## Learning Approach

My approach involves:

* Following the W3Schools Java tutorial systematically.
* Writing and running code examples to solidify understanding.
* Experimenting with variations and extensions of the examples.
* Reviewing and practicing concepts regularly.
* Documenting my learning process in this repository.

## Future Plans
